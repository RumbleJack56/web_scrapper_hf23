# 🌟 Web Scrapper 🌟
<img align='right' src="https://github.com/anupammaurya6767/web_scrapper/blob/main/assets/tan.jpg" alt="Tanjiro-sama" width="300" height="400">
Welcome to our web scrapping repository! This repository contains various scraping scripts using modules like lxml, BeautifulSoup, and Selenium to gather data from different  websites. 🎉




## 📁 Directory Structure

The repository follows a structured approach for organizing scraping scripts:

📦 web-scrapper-repo </br>
┣ 📂 site1 </br>
┃ ┣ 📜 script.py </br>
┃ ┗ 📜 README.md </br>
┃ ┗ 📜 requirements.txt </br>
┣ 📂 site2 </br>
┃ ┣ 📜 script.py </br>
┃ ┗ 📜 README.md </br>
┃ ┗ 📜 requirements.txt </br>
┗ ...


Each folder (`site1`, `site2`, etc.) corresponds to a different website that we have scraped. Inside each folder, you'll find a scraping script (`script.py`) and a README.md file providing information about the scraped data.
